    "`ndarrays` are efficient containers of numerical data of the same type (i.e., signed/unsigned chars, signed/unsigned integers or `mp_float_t`s, which, depending on the platform, are either C `float`s, or C `double`s). Beyond storing the actual data in the void pointer `*array`, the type definition has eight additional members (on top of the `base` type). Namely, the `dtype`, which tells us, how the bytes are to be interpreted. Moreover, the `itemsize`, which stores the size of a single entry in the array, `boolean`, an unsigned integer, which determines, whether the arrays is to be treated as a set of Booleans, or as numerical data, `ndim`, the number of dimensions (`uint8_t`), `len`, the length of the array (the number of entries), the shape (`*size_t`), the strides (`*int32_t`). The length is simply the product of the numbers in `shape`.\n",

If the number of actual dimensions, `ndim < ULAB_MAX_DIMS`, the first `ULAB_MAX_DIMS - ndim` entries in `shape` and `strides` will be equal to zero, but they could, in fact, be assigned any value, because these will never be accessed in an operation.\n",

    "## Iterating over two ndarrays simultaneously: broadcasting\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we invoke a binary operator, call a function with two arguments of `ndarray` type, or assign something to an `ndarray`, we have to iterate over two views at the same time. The task is trivial, if the two `ndarray`s in question have the same shape (but not necessarily the same set of strides), because in this case, we can still iterate in the same loop. All that happens is that we move two data pointers in sync.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem becomes a bit more involving, when the shapes of the two `ndarray`s are not identical. For such cases, `numpy` defines so-called broadcasting, which boils down to two rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The shapes in the tensor with lower rank has to be prepended with axes of size 1 till the two ranks become equal.\n",
    "2. Along all axes the two tensors should have the same size, or one of the sizes must be 1. \n",

At that point, we move the pointer by an amount dictated by the strides. And this is the key: *dictated by the strides*. Now, if we have two arrays that are originally not compatible, we define new strides for them, and use these in the iteration. With that, we are back to the case, where we had two compatible arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let us look at the second broadcasting rule: if the two arrays have the same size, we take both `ndarray`s' strides along that axis.

This will ensure that that data pointer is not moved, when we iterate over both `ndarray`s at the same time. \n",

    "2. If the input is an `ndarray_obj_t`, acquire a pointer to it by calling `ndarray_obj_t *ndarray = MP_OBJ_TO_PTR(arg);`\n",

    "4. Once the new data have been calculated, return a `micropython` object by calling `MP_OBJ_FROM_PTR(...)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The listing above contains the implementation of the function, but as such, it cannot be called from `python`: \n",
    "it still has to be bound to the name space. This we do by first defining a function object in \n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "MP_DEFINE_CONST_FUN_OBJ_1(user_square_obj, user_square);\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`micropython` defines a number of `MP_DEFINE_CONST_FUN_OBJ_N` macros in [obj.h](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/blob/master/py/obj.h). `N` is always the number of arguments the function takes. We had a function definition `static mp_obj_t user_square(mp_obj_t arg)`, i.e., we dealt with a single argument. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have to bind this function object in the globals table of the `user` module: \n",

    "```c\n",
    "static const mp_rom_map_elem_t ulab_user_globals_table[] = {\n",
    "    { MP_OBJ_NEW_QSTR(MP_QSTR___name__), MP_OBJ_NEW_QSTR(MP_QSTR_user) },\n",

    "```\n",

    "Thus, the three steps required for the definition of a user-defined function are \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The low-level implementation of the function itself\n",
    "2. The definition of a function object by calling MP_DEFINE_CONST_FUN_OBJ_N()\n",
    "3. Binding this function object to the namespace in the `ulab_user_globals_table[]`"
